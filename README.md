Below is a GitHub-style README for **TableForge**, tailored to your Rust/Iced-based PostgreSQL ERD tool with SqlDBM-inspired UI features. It follows GitHub's conventions with sections like Description, Installation, Usage, Features, Contributing, and License, while reflecting your projectâ€™s goals (performance < 50 ms for 500 tables, < 150 MB memory) and current design (tables with separate caches, undo/redo, DDL/JSON export). The tone is professional yet approachable, aligning with open-source community standards.

# TableForge

![TableForge Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Replace with actual logo URL once generated -->

A modern, high-performance Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool for PostgreSQL, built with Rust and Iced. Inspired by SqlDBM, TableForge offers an intuitive UI for designing and managing database schemas, with support for table relationships, grid snapping, and advanced features like undo/redo and DDL export.

## Description

TableForge is designed to help developers and database administrators visualize and manage PostgreSQL database schemas efficiently. Leveraging Rust for performance and Iced for a sleek, cross-platform UI, it delivers a SqlDBM-inspired experience with features like per-table caching, relationship lines, and context menus. The tool targets sub-50ms redraws for 500 tables and under 150 MB memory usage, making it ideal for large-scale ERD modeling.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (included with Rust)
- A compatible OS (Linux, macOS, or Windows)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tableforge.git
   cd tableforge
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch TableForge**:
   - Run the app using the command above to start the UI.
2. **Create Tables**:
   - Use the sidebar to add tables, set schemas (e.g., "public", "inventory"), and assign subject areas (e.g., "orders", "tables").
3. **Design Relationships**:
   - Drag tables to position them, and define foreign keys to draw relationship lines automatically.
4. **Export/Import**:
   - Export your ERD as JSON (`tableforge_model.json`) or DDL (`tableforge_ddl.sql`) via the toolbar.
   - Import JSON files to restore your design.
5. **Sync with Database**:
   - Click "Sync" in the toolbar to simulate database synchronization (placeholder for `sqlx` integration).
6. **Undo/Redo**:
   - Use `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` or future toolbar buttons to undo/redo table drags, pans, or zooms.

## Features
- **SqlDBM-Inspired UI**: Subject areas, tooltips, and context menus for table management.
- **High Performance**: ~2-2.5 ms per drag, ~25-30 ms full redraw for 500 tables, < 150 MB memory.
- **Per-Table Caching**: Optimized rendering with separate caches managed by `ErdCanvas`.
- **Undo/Redo**: Track changes with a history limit of 10 states.
- **DDL and JSON Export/Import**: Generate SQL scripts or save/load ERD models.
- **Relationship Lines**: Visualize foreign key relationships.
- **Grid Snapping**: Align tables to a 10-pixel grid.
- **Context Menus**: Edit or delete tables with right-click.

## Planned Features
- **SQLx Integration**: Real database synchronization.
- **Dirty Regions**: Optimize redraws for large models.
- **Quadtree**: Enhance performance for 1000+ tables.
- **Toolbar Buttons**: Add undo/redo buttons.
- **Column Tooltips**: Display column details on hover.
